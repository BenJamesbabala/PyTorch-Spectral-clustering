## Goal
Use with Pytorch for general purpose computations by implementing some very elegant methods for dimensionality reduction and graph spectral clustering. 
<br />

## Description
In this repo, I am using PyTorch in order to implement various methods for dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering.
At the moment, I have added Diffusion Maps [1] and I am working on the methods presented in the following list (as well as some other that I will add in the future).  
<br />

Except from some examples based on 2-D Gaussian distributed clusters I will also add examples with face, food, imagenet categories etc.
<br />


## Prerequisites
In order to run these examples you need to have Pytorch installed in your system. I worked with Anaconda2 and Pytorch:<br />

    pytorch                   0.2.0           py27hc03bea1_4cu80  [cuda80]  soumith
<br />
(you can verify your pytorch installation by running 

    conda list | grep pytorch

Feel free to contact me for suggestions, comments etc.
