# PyTorch-Spectral-clustering
[Under development]- Implementation of various methods for dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering with PyTorch.
<br />
Goal: Use with Pytorch for general purpose computations by implementing some very elegant methods for dimensionality reduction and graph spectral clustering. 
<br />

In this repo, I am using PyTorch in order to implement various methods for dimensionality reduction and spectral clustering.
At the moment, I have added Diffusion Maps [1] and I am working on the methods presented in the following list (as well as some other that I will add in the future).  
<br />

Except from some examples based on 2-D Gaussian distributed clusters I will also add examples with face, food, imagenet categories etc.
<br />

Feel free to contact me for suggestions, comments etc.
